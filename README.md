Alfred Workflows
================

These are custom Alfred Workflows I have made which helps me in my day-to-day.

- [Spotify shortcuts]: made to mimic how I used to control Spotify in
  Quicksilver and has an extra to open the current playing song on Genius.com
- [Toggle microphone]: I use multiple apps to meet on the regular and they all
  have different shortcuts to mute yourself. This binds it to one shortcut
  that toggles the mic on/off on the system level.
  - This workflow uses some scrips from my [bin folder]
- [uuidgen]: Generate a lowercase uuid and make it available as a snippet

[Spotify shortcuts]: ./Spotify%20keyboard%20shortcuts.alfredworkflow
[Toggle microphone]: ./Toggle%20mute%20mic.alfredworkflow
[uuidgen]: ./uuidgen.alfredworkflow
[bin folder]: https://github.com/gaqzi/conf/tree/master/bin
